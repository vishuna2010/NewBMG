# Insurance Broker Backend & Customer Portal

## 1. Application Overview

This project is the backend system for an insurance brokerage, designed to manage customers, policies, claims, and products. It also includes specifications for a customer-facing portal allowing clients to view their policies, submit claims, and manage their profiles.

The system aims to streamline broker operations and enhance customer self-service capabilities.
