# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It's a common convention to use .gitkeep files to ensure that Git tracks
# otherwise empty directories. This helps maintain the intended folder structure
# in the repository even before actual code files are added to these directories.

# You can remove this file once you add other files to the 'src/config' directory.
